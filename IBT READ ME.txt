PACKAGE # 1: Deconv-IBT

	This package is used to process the 3D IBT DATA from Raw SIMS Scans
	Example data-sets: chromatin and nanoTags
	MATLAB pipeline: deconvIBT (short slices and 3D batch processing for entire stack)
	MATLAB deconvIBTsubfunctions: please add these to directory
	Python/Jupyter file for Deconvolution: deconvIBT.ipynb (MATLAB works better, but one can compare)

PACKAGE # 2: SILM-IBT

	This package is used to process the 3D IBT DATA from Raw SIMS Scans
	Example data-sets: iodrep-3x-all-100 and sequenceiduchromatin
	PYTHON/Jupyter pipeline: silm-chromatin-idu (A test series and entire batch processing for 3D IBT stacks)
	PYTHON subfolder: storm_analysis make sure to add to your current directory (See here for more comparisons to STORM fluorescence data: https://github.com/ZhuangLab/storm-analysis)


PACKAGE # 3: Deep Learning-IBT

	This package is used to process the 3D IBT DATA from Raw SIMS Scans in comparison to SILM-IBT reconstructed images
	Example data-sets: IBT-SOFTWARE\DeepLearning-IBT\projection\data
	PYTHON/Jupyter pipeline: IBT-SOFTWARE\DeepLearning-IBT\projection and files deepIBTidu.ipynb (similar ones:deepIBTbrdu.ipynb, deepIBTsi.ipynb, and deepIBTfluo)
	PYTHON subfolder: csbdeep and my_model make sure to add to your current directory (See here for more comparisons to Deep learning in fluorescene data: https://csbdeep.bioimagecomputing.com/)

PACKAGE # 4: 3D Spatial clustering of IBT data by k-means 
	
	This package is used to process the reconstructed 3D IBT DATA (Deconv-IBT, SILM-IBT, DL-IBT) 
	Example data-sets: Deconvcell
	PYTHON/Jupyter pipeline: MainCodeEditedFiveGTCell11
	Example results: Cell11data..., presented in Fig. 6c

PACKAGE # 5: R-STUDIO BASED Quantification of IBT voxel data cubes using heatmap, bar plots with significance, correlation maps, and association circular representations
	
	The extracted excel files from IBT data is analyzed by R interface
	BAR PLOTS: IBT-STATS (for replication, transcription, and chromatin overlaps with statistical significance), presented in Fig 4c, 5c and SI Fig. 34a
	BAR PLOTS FOR transcription with inhibitors: IBT-STATS with and without normalization, SI Fig. 41 folder
	CORRELATION, ASSOCIATION AND HEATMAPS: Circmaps and example plots SI Fig44 a-l
	3D LABEL-FREE TISSUE NEIGHBORHOOD ANALYSIS: IBT-STATS-neighborhoods, presented in SI Fig 46


PACKAGE # 6: RESOLUTION ANALYSIS OF EDGE SCANS BEFORE AND AFTER DECONV-IBT USING ERF FITS
	RAW DATA, .M Files, And Subfunctions are provided.
