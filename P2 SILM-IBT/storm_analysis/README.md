diagnostics - Code for evaluating the performance of different aspects of the different fitters, drift correction, etc..

fista - The code to perform FISTA image deconvolution following [Beck and Teboulle](http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/080716542).

frc - The code to perform FRC analysis following [Nieuwenhuizen et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2448).

multi_plane - The code to analyze one or more planes of data from sCMOS camera(s) as described in this publication [Babcock](http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1038/s41598-018-19981-z).

psf_fft - The code to analyze SMLM movies by fitting the measured PSF (using a FFT based approach).

pupilfn - The code to analyze SMLM movies by fitting pupil functions.

rcc - The code to perform RCC drift correction following [Wang et al](http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.22.015982).

sa_library - A collection of Python (and C) libraries that provide functionality whose utility is not limited to just a support role for 3D-DAOSTORM (and other analysis approaches).

sa_utilities - A collection of Python and C programs that perform functions such as tracking single molecules across multiple frames or determining and applying drift correction. These are used by 3D-DAOSTORM, but as with the functions in the library directory they are considered to be of more general utility.

simulator - A simulator for generating test data.

slurm - Code for running storm-analysis in a distributed computing environment that uses [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) for job management.
