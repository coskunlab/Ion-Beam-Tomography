"""
Measure the PSF given the raw data and localization analysis. In
theory this will be more accurate as you are using fit locations
instead of locations that were entered by hand.

2D: The expected input is a movie file that contains images
    of single molecules & the corresponding analysis file
    as created by Spliner, 3D-DAOSTORM or sCMOS.

3D: The expected input is a movie file that contains images of
    single molecules at different z positions. This movie file
    needs to have been analyzed with Spliner, 3D-DAOSTORM or sCMOS.

Similar to measure_psf_beads, depending on your setup you may need to change:
  1. The z range (z_range).
  2. The pixel size (pixel_size).
  3. The AOI size (aoi_size). This is less important as you
     will get to specify the final size to use when you use
     psf_to_spline.py to create the spline to use for fitting.
     It should be large enough so that there is no overlap
     between the PSFs of two different peaks.
