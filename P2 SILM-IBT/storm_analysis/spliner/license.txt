C-Spline analysis of STORM Data.

Academic and Non-Commercial Research Use Software License and Terms of Use

The C-Spline software is designed for the analysis of STORM data using a spline
based approach. It is particularly well suited for the analysis of 2D and 3D
STORM image data with PSFs that are hard to approximate analytically.

The C-Spline STORM analysis software (the "Software") was developed by Hazen
Babcock and Xiaowei Zhuang. The project was supported by NIH and HHMI. It is
distributed for free academic and non-commercial research use by President
and Fellows of Harvard College ("Harvard").

Using the Software indicates your agreement to be bound by the terms of this 
Software Use Agreement ("Agreement"). Absent your agreement to the terms below, 
you (the "End User") have no rights to hold or use the Software whatsoever. 

Harvard agrees to grant hereunder the limited non-exclusive license to End User 
for the use of the Software in performance of End User's internal, non-profit 
research and academic use at End User's institution on the following terms and 
conditions: 

1. NO REDISTRIBUTION. Software remains the property Harvard and End User 
  shall not publish, distribute, or otherwise transfer or make available the 
  Software to any other party.

2. NO COMMERCIAL USE. End User shall not use the Software for commercial purposes 
  and any such use of the Software is expressly prohibited. This includes, but is 
  not limited to, use of the Software in fee-for-service arrangements, core facilities 
  or laboratories or to provide research services to third parties for a fee. This 
  does not exclude, however, End User's use of the Software with bona fide collaborators 
  of the End User working on industry-sponsored collaborative research projects. 
  If End User wishes to use Software for commercial purposes or for any other restricted 
  purpose, End User must execute a separate license agreement with the Harvard.
